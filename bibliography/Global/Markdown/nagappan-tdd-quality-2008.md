Abstract Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development practice that has been
used sporadically for decades. With this practice, a software engineer cycles minute-by-minute
between writing failing unit tests and writing implementation code to pass those tests. Test-
driven development has recently re-emerged as a critical enabling practice of agile software
development methodologies. However, little empirical evidence supports or refutes the utility
of this practice in an industrial context. Case studies were conducted with three development
teams at Microsoft and one at IBM that have adopted TDD. The results of the case studies
indicate that the pre-release defect density of the four products decreased between 40% and
90% relative to similar projects that did not use the TDD practice. Subjectively, the teams
experienced a 15–35% increase in initial development time after adopting TDD.

1 Introduction

Test-driven development (TDD) (Beck 2003) is an “opportunistic” (Curtis 1989) software
development practice that has been used sporadically for decades (Larman and Basili 2003;

Gelperin and Hetzel 1987). With this practice, a software engineer cycles minute-by-minute
between writing failing unit tests and writing implementation code to pass those tests. Test-
driven development has recently re-emerged as a critical enabling practice of agile software
development methodologies (Cockburn 2001), in particular Extreme Programming (XP;
Beck 2005). However, little empirical evidence supports or refutes the utility of this practice
in an industrial context.
   In this paper we report on “in vivo” case studies of four software development teams that
have adopted the TDD or TDD-inspired practice, one team from IBM (Williams et al. 2003)
and three from Microsoft (Bhat and Nagappan 2006). We study TDD as a stand alone
software development practice; in that, we do investigate TDD within the prevailing
development processes at IBM and Microsoft and not within the context of XP. In this
paper, we share details about the projects, the teams, and how they used TDD in their
projects. We compare the quality and development time of the product developed by a team
using TDD relative to a similar team that did not use TDD. Finally, we provide lessons
learned by these four teams.
   Case studies can be viewed as “research in the typical,” (Kitchenham et al. 1995;
Fenton and Pfleeger 1998) increasing the degree to which the results can be compared
with those of other industrial teams. However, case studies cannot be performed with the
rigor of experiments because they involve real people, real projects, and real customers
over a relatively long period of time. In empirical research, replication of studies is a
crucial factor to building an empirical body of knowledge about a practice or a process.
The four studies presented in this paper contribute towards strengthening of the empirical
knowledge of the efficacy of TDD because each case study was conducted in a different
context, as shown Fig. 1. The details of the contexts of each case study are discussed
throughout the paper.
   The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of TDD and
Section 3 the related works. Section 4 explains the context variables of our projects, and
Section 5 their individual TDD implementation practices. Section 6 presents the results of
the study and Section 7 the threats to validity. Section 8 presents the lessons learned for the
benefits of organizations new to TDD or thinking about adopting the practice.

2 Test Driven Development

When discussing TDD we consider a task to be a subset of a requirement that can be
implemented in a few days or less (Beck and Fowler 2001). As illustrated in Fig. 2, TDD
software engineers develop production code through rapid iterations of the following:
Minute-by-minute cycles:
–   Writing a small number of new and failing automated unit test case(s) for the task at
    hand
–   Implementing code which should allow the new unit tests cases to pass
–   Re-running the new unit test cases to ensure they now pass with the new code
Per-task cycles:
–   Integrate code and tests for new code into existing code base
–   Re-running all the test cases in the code base to ensure the new code does not break
    any previously running test cases
–   Refactoring the implementation or test code (as necessary)
–   Re-running all tests in the code base to ensure that the refactored code does not break
    any previously passing test cases
In TDD, code development is kept within the developer’s intellectual control because he or she
is continuously making small design and implementation decisions and increasing functionality
at a relatively consistent rate. New functionality is not considered properly implemented unless
the new unit test cases and every other unit test cases written for the code base run properly.
Some possible benefits of TDD are:
–   Better Design. TDD is considered as much of (and in some cases, more of) a design
    process than a test process. Kent Beck, the person responsible for the inclusion of TDD
    in XP and Ward Cunningham, an early proponent of TDD in an XP context,
    immediately stated, “Test-first coding is not a testing technique” (Beck 2001; Note: the
    test-first coding practice eventually came to be known as TDD). They assert that TDD

      is an analysis and design technique and that: “Test-first code tends to be more cohesive
      and less coupled than code in which testing isn’t part of the intimate coding cycle”
      (Beck 2001).
–     Efficiency. The fine granularity of test-then-code cycle gives continuous feedback to
      the developer. With TDD, faults and/or defects are identified very early and quickly as
      new code is added to the system. Consequently, the source of the problem is also more
      easily determined since the problems have not been in existence for long. We contend
      that the efficiency of fault and defect removal and the corresponding reduction in the
      debugging and maintenance time compensates for the additional time spent writing and
      executing test cases.
–     Test Assets. The automated unit test cases written with TDD are valuable assets to the
      project. Subsequently, when the code is enhanced, modified, or updated, running the
      automated unit tests may be used for the identification of newly introduced defects, i.e.,
      for regression testing.
–     Reducing Defect Injection. Unfortunately, maintenance fixes and “small” code changes
      may be nearly 40 times more error prone than new development (Humphrey 1989), and
      often, new faults are injected during the debugging and maintenance phases. The ease
      of running the automated test cases after changes are made should also enable smooth
      integration of new functionality into the code base and therefore reduce the likelihood
      that fixes and maintenance changes introduce new defects. The TDD test cases are
      essentially a high-granularity, low-level, regression test. By continuously running these
      automated test cases, one can find out whether a change breaks the existing system
      early on, rather than leading to a late discovery.


3 Related Works

We briefly summarize the relevant empirical studies on TDD and their high level results.
George and Williams (George and Williams 2003a, b) performed a structured experiment
involving 24 professional programmers from John Deere, Rolemodel Software, and
Ericsson, to investigate the efficacy of TDD. One group developed a small Java program
using TDD while the other control group used a waterfall-like approach. Experimental
results indicated that TDD programmers produce higher quality code because they passed
18% more functional black-box test cases. On the other hand, the TDD programmers took
16% more time. However, the programmers in the control group often did not write the
required automated test cases after completing their code.
    Müller and Hagner (2002) found that a TDD-variant did not help produce a higher
quality system. In this study, the programmers (graduate computer science students) had to
write their complete set of automated unit test cases before writing any production code
rather than in the highly iterative manner of TDD. Erdogmus et al. (2005) performed a
controlled investigation regarding test-first and test-last programming using 24 undergrad-
uate computer science students. They observed that TDD improved programmer
productivity but did not, on average, help the engineers to achieve a higher quality
product. Their conclusions also brought out a valid point that the effectiveness of the test-
first technique depends on the ability to encourage programmers to enhance their code with
test assets. Müller and Tichy (2001) investigated XP in a university context using 11
students. From a testing perspective they observed that, in the final review of the course,
87% of the students stated that the execution of the test cases strengthened their confidence
in their code.
Empir Software Eng (2008) 13:289–302                                                          293


   Janzen and Seiedian (2006) conducted an experiment with undergraduate students in a
software engineering course. Students in three groups completed semester-long program-
ming projects using either an iterative test-first (TDD), iterative test-last, or linear test-last
approach. Results from this study indicate that TDD can be an effective software design
approach improving both code-centric aspects such as object decomposition, test coverage,
and external quality, as well as developer-centric aspects, which includes productivity and
confidence.
   Our work builds up on the prior empirical work in this area. Few case studies examine
the use of TDD in an industrial context. Our paper contributes to the empirical base of
knowledge about the TDD practice by combining results of four empirical studies carried
out in different industrial contexts and environments.


4 The Projects and the Teams

In this section, we provide information about the four products and teams and the contexts
into which the projects were executed. As a cautionary note, as with all empirical research,
the results should not be taken to be valid in the general sense, only in the context in which
the case study was conducted.

4.1 IBM

The IBM case study was conducted with a group that has been developing device drivers
for over a decade. They have one legacy product that has undergone seven releases since
late 1998. This legacy product was used as the baseline in our case study. In 2002, the
group developed the device drivers on a new platform and moved to a completely new
architecture. In our case study, we compare the seventh release of the legacy platform with
the first release of the new platform. Because of its longevity, the legacy system handles
more classes of devices, on multiple bus connectivity, with more vendors’ devices than the
new system. Hence, while not a true control group, the legacy software can still provide a
valuable relative insight into the performance of the TDD methodology since the two
products exposed the same interfaces for the same set of devices—a JavaPOS1 interface.
The device drivers from the legacy code base were wrapped using JNI to expose the Java™
interface, and in the new system, the device drivers were mostly entirely implemented in
the Java technology.

4.2 Microsoft

The three case studies at Microsoft were distributed across three of the main product
families, Windows, MSN, and Visual Studio (Bhat and Nagappan 2006). The TDD and
non-TDD projects are developed by teams led by project managers with similar levels of
responsibilities and reporting to the same higher-level manager. As a result, our
comparisons involve projects in a similar usage domain. We therefore avoid making
unequal comparisons, as would be the case in comparing, for example, computer game and
nuclear reactor software. Also, these projects were analyzed post hoc, and the developers
did not know during development that their work was going to be assessed. Therefore, the
case study did not interfere with the developers’ performance. There was no enforcement

and monitoring of the TDD practice; and decisions to use TDD were made as a group.
More detail is provided on the projects completed by each of the three teams:
&     Windows: This case study was performed in the Networking team. The networking
      common library was written by the tool development team as a re-usable set of
      modules for different projects within the networking tools team. Some examples
      are generic packet manipulation routines, command line manipulation, memory
      allocation and tracking routines, random number generator, and timer classes. This
      library is used by more than 50 internal applications.
&     MSN: This case study involves a Web services application in the MSN division.
      MSN is a business division of Microsoft that works on Web service applications
      that range from online shopping to news and Web search technologies.
&     Developer Division: This project is part of the Visual Studio (VS) software
      development system. Visual Studio provides a range of tools for individual
      developers and software development teams. Visual Studio allows for the
      development of stand-alone applications, Web service applications, and so on.

4.3 Examining the Range of Teams and Products

Tables 1 and 2 respectively show a summary of a comparison between the team and the product
measures. The team factors enable us to understand the composition of these four teams. The
product factors present a comparative view of the size and effort associated with the projects.
   Across the four projects, we observe that the teams are experienced; the majority of the
team members had around 6–10 years experience. In the MSN team, the developers are
experienced but only have moderate domain and programming language expertise. The
IBM project has four developers who were inexperienced. Further, the IBM project was
developed in a distributed context with five developers in Raleigh, NC and four in
Guadalajara, Mexico. No one on the new IBM team knew TDD beforehand, and three were
somewhat unfamiliar with Java. In the IBM case, all but two of the nine full-time
developers were novices to the targeted devices.

   From the data in Table 2, we observe that the projects are of different sizes ranging from six
thousand lines of code (KLOC) to 155 KLOC and in development time from 24 to 119 person
man-months. The test-to-source line of code (LOC) ratio and code coverage varies, reflecting
the environmental and usage requirements that play an important part in defining these metrics.
These projects were non-legacy applications, i.e., written completely or mostly from scratch.


5 TDD Implementations

In this section, we provide more detail about the TDD practice used by each team.

5.1 IBM

The unit testing approach of the legacy group can be classified as largely ad-hoc. The
developers would code a prototype of the utility classes (classes which collaborate with
other classes) and of classes that are expected to be reused; and then create a design via
UML class and sequence diagrams (Fowler 2000). This design was then followed by an
implementation stage that sometimes caused design changes, and thus some iteration
between the design and the coding phases. Unit testing followed as a post-coding activity.
In all cases, the unit test process was not formal and was not disciplined. More often than
not, there were resource and schedule limitations that constrained the number of test cases
developed and run. Most of the unit tests developed were also not reused during the
subsequent Functional Verification Test (FVT) phase, when a defect was found, or when a
new release of the software was developed.
   With the TDD group, test cases were developed mostly up front as a means of reducing
ambiguity and to validate the requirements, which for this team was a full detail standard
specification. UML class and sequence diagrams were used to develop an initial design.
This design activity was interspersed with the up-front unit test creations for developed
classes. Complete unit testing was enforced—primarily via reminders and encouragements.
We define complete testing as ensuring that the public interfaces and semantics of each
method (the behavior of the method as defined by the specification) were tested utilizing
the JUnit2 unit-testing framework. For each public class, there was an associated public test
class; for each public method in the class there was an associated public test method in the

296                                                        Empir Software Eng (2008) 13:289–302


corresponding unit test class. The target goal was to cover at least 80% of the developed
classes by automated unit testing.
    Since TDD was geographically distributed in two different locations, to guarantee that
all unit tests would be run by all members of the team, an automated build and test systems
was set up in both geographical locations. Daily, the build systems extracted all the code
from the library build the code and ran all the unit tests. The Apache ANT3 build tool was
used. After each automated build and test run cycle, an email was sent to all members of the
teams listing all the tests that successfully ran as well as any errors found. This automated
build and test served as a daily integration and validation heartbeat for the team.
    With both the legacy and new projects, when the majority of the device driver code was
implemented and passed all their own unit tests and those in the code base also passed, the
device drivers were sent to FVT. The external FVT team (different from both development
legacy and “new project” teams) had written black box test cases based on the functional
system specification. More than half of the FVT tests were automated in part; the remaining
tests were split fairly evenly between fully automated and fully manual. Both the legacy
and new teams faced the same degree of schedule pressure.

5.2 Microsoft

The TDD team at Microsoft did most of their development using a hybrid version of TDD. By
hybrid we mean that these projects as with almost all projects at Microsoft had detailed
requirements documents written. These detailed requirements documents drove the test and
development effort. There were also design meetings and review sessions. This explains our
reason to call this a hybrid-TDD approach, as agile teams typically do not have design review
meetings. The three teams studied did not use agile software development practices except for
TDD. The legacy teams did not use any agile methodologies nor the TDD practice.
   The development methodology at Microsoft is a hybrid of the waterfall approach (Royce
1970). Our meaning of hybrid denoted not purely waterfall but with one with variations.
First, the requirements are gathered from various sources, e.g., customers, partners,
stakeholders, and market study results. Program managers come up with an extensive list of
features and write the requirements. Based on iterations with the development teams, the
final set of requirements is written. This serves as the functional requirements checklist for
the features to be implemented. From here on, teams have design discussions and design
reviews where preliminary design is completed and implementation (with integrated unit,
system, stress, and functional testing) starts. Then the requirements are fully implemented
and developed; this phase is otherwise known as “code-complete.” During the development
and testing process a variety of tools are used in addition to the TDD practices, such as
static analysis tools (Larus et al. 2004), dependency analysis tools (Srivastava et al. 2005),
as well as fault-injection tools.
   From the context of TDD, the unit test framework used was run from the command line.
The unit test framework enables the developer to figure out the status of the test run from the
command line. The log files obtained from the runs are used for deeper analysis and highlight
passing and failing tests (Bhat and Nagappan 2006). Further, some teams also implemented a
mechanism that would identify when a unit test failed and sent an automated email to the
developers whose code or test failed. This is done to help ensure timely fixing of the code.
   The teams checked in source and unit test code into an integrated version control system
through which the system is built. The three projects at Microsoft had different build

processes as they had different execution and usage requirements. The teams did not have
any particular target coverage measures. Functionality was the main driver for the resulting
code coverage. The completion was determined by satisfying the requirements stated in the
initially developed requirements document. The teams recognized the different coverage
requirement needs for system level code, core architectural components, GUIs, and so on.


6 Quality and Productivity Results

We measure the quality of the software products in terms of defect density computed as
defects/thousand lines of code (KLOC).
   “When software is being developed, a person makes an error that results in a physical
   fault (or defect) in a software element. When this element is executed, traversal of the
   fault or defect may put the element (or system) into an erroneous state. When this
   erroneous state results in an externally visible anomaly, we say that a failure has
   occurred” (IEEE 1988).
We use the above-stated definition of defect as an error made by a developer that results in
a physical fault in the system and normalize it per KLOC in order to derive our quality
measure named defect density.
   We now discuss our outcome measures. We compare the TDD and non-TDD project for a
change in defect density, as shown in Table 3. We use defect density as an approximate overall
indicator of the quality of the code from the point of integration stability. Defect information
is mined from IBM’s and Microsoft’s bug databases. The defects measured for Microsoft
include all defects reported post-integration, such as design defects, code review defects, test
defects, integration defects, stress-test defects, customer defects, security defects, static
analysis tool defects, and performance defects, as well as customer-reported problems. The
IBM defects cover the same categories but are flagged to indicate if the defect was identified
from an internal user (e.g., tester) or from external users at a customer location. The latter tend
to have higher priorities since they directly impact overall customer satisfaction.
   All the teams demonstrated a significant drop in defect density: 40% for the IBM team;
60–90% for the Microsoft teams. One would expect the legacy IBM product to have exhibit
a lower defect because it has a substantial portion of legacy code that has already been
tested and exposed to the field in prior releases. For the new IBM project developed using
TDD, most of the code written is new and has not been exposed to the field. Part of the
intuition behind the difference can be attributed to the fact that with the legacy system the
additional code, while being added to a stable production code base, would cause cascading
defects that were hard to identify early on. As opposed to, the iterative nature of TDD that
helps identify and control the injection of faults.

   Another interesting observation from the outcome measures in Table 3 is the increase in
time to develop the features attributed to the usage of the TDD practice, as subjectively
estimated by management. The increase in development time ranges from 15% to 35%.
From an efficacy perspective this increase in development time is offset by the by the
reduced maintenance costs due to the improvement in quality (Erdogmus and Williams
2003), an observation that was backed up the product teams at Microsoft and IBM.


7 Threats to Validity

In this section we list threats that potentially would invalidate our results and findings, in
order to limit the scope our claims as well as explain their utility. Developers using TDD
might have been more motivated to produce higher quality code as they were trying out a
new process and might have been motivated to prove that TDD worked efficiently for them.
To an extent, this concern is alleviated because these were professional programmers all of
whom were more concerned with completing their tasks than with the quality improvement
results of a new development practice. Furthermore, the TDD and non-TDD teams did not
know that they would be part of a study anytime during their development cycle.
   The projects developed using TDD might have been easier to develop, as there can never
be an accurate equal comparison between two projects except in a controlled case study. In
our case studies, we alleviated this concern to some degree by the fact that these systems
were compared within the same organization (with the same higher-level manager and sub-
culture). Therefore, the complexity of the TDD and non-TDD projects are comparable.
Another related issue is the comparison of new projects (done with TDD) with an
enhancement to a legacy systems (not done with TDD). The legacy systems might have had
existing problems that could cause legacy systems to have higher defect density than the
new TDD systems and/or the legacy system could have a lower defect density because the
code has been tested and exposed to the field in prior releases.
   As previously mentioned, case studies are used to collect data through observation of a
project in an unmodified, contextual setting (Zelkowitz and Wallace 1998). Case studies (or
N=1 experiments [Harrison 1997]) can be viewed as “research in the typical” (Kitchenham
et al. 1995; Fenton and Pfleeger 1998) and are an evaluative technique carried out with
realistic tasks and realistic subjects in a realistic environment (Fenton et al. 1994; Sjøberg
et al. 2002). However, comparisons made via case studies can never be perfect due to the
complex contexts of both the compared projects. Additionally, a family of case studies is
likely not to yield statistically significant results, though Harrison (2004) observes that
statistical significance has not been shown to impact industrial practice.
   Drawing general conclusions from empirical studies in software engineering is difficult
because any process depends to a large degree on a potentially large number of relevant
context variables. For this reason, we cannot assume a priori that the results of a study
generalize beyond the specific environment in which it was conducted (Basili et al. 1999).
Researchers become more confident in a theory when similar findings emerge in different
contexts (Basili et al. 1999). Towards this end, we intend that our case study will help
contribute towards strengthening the existing empirical body of knowledge in this field
(Müller and Tichy 2001; Müller and Hagner 2002; George and Williams 2003a, b; Williams
et al. 2003; Erdogmus et al. 2005) by replicating across different context variables and
environments. Several teams at Microsoft and at IBM employ TDD as part of the
development process. We intend to collect future data from all these projects and continue
build an empirical body of knowledge in this field.

8 Conclusions and Discussion

Our experiences and distilled lessons learned, all point to the fact that TDD seems to be
applicable in various domains and can significantly reduce the defect density of developed
software without significant productivity reduction of the development team. Additionally,
since an important aspect of TDD is the creation of test assets—unit, functional, and
integration tests. Future releases of these products, as they continue using TDD, will also
experience low defect densities due to the use of these test assets. Specifically, recent
contact with the IBM team indicated that in one of the subsequent releases (more than five
releases since the case study) some members of the team (grown 50% since the first release)
have taken some shortcuts by not running the unit tests, and consequently the defect density
increased temporally compared to previous releases. As part of our future studies of TDD
and non-TDD teams we plan on incorporating effort measurement in-process, collecting
design effort (along with design measures), testing effort, and refactoring effort. Another
interesting future work plan is to investigate TDD in legacy systems. Most research to date
has focused on new systems. We plan on evaluating the incremental effort required to do
TDD in legacy systems working with pre-existing dependencies.
   Additionally, we have gained experiences and lessons with transitioning to TDD that we
wish to share with other teams. Some of the practices can work well without TDD too and
can prove to be beneficial to the teams. These were not part of the empirical evaluation
study and are qualitative recommendations based on our learning experiences.
–   Start TDD from the beginning of projects. Do not stop in the middle and claim it
    doesn’t work. Do not start TDD late in the project cycle when the design has already
    been decided and majority of the code has been written. TDD is best done
    incrementally and continuously.
–   For a team new to TDD, introduce automated build test integration towards the second
    third of the development phase—not too early but not too late. If this is a “Greenfield”
    project, adding the automated build test towards the second third of the development
    schedule allows the team to adjust to and become familiar with TDD. Prior to the
    automated build test integration, each developer should run all the test cases on their
    own machine.
–   Convince the development team to add new tests every time a problem is found, no
    matter when the problem is found. By doing so, the unit test suites improve during the
    development and test phases.
–   Get the test team involved and knowledgeable about the TDD approach. The test team
    should not accept new development release if the unit tests are failing.
–   Hold a thorough review of an initial unit test plan, setting an ambitious goal of having
    the highest possible (agreed upon) code coverage targets.
–   Constantly running the unit tests cases in a daily automatic build (or continuous
    integration); tests run should become the heartbeat of the system as well as a means to
    track progress of the development. This also gives a level of confidence to the team
    when new features are added.
–   Encourage fast unit test execution and efficient unit test design. Test execution speed is
    very important since when all the tests are integrated, the complete execution can
    become quite long for a reasonably-sized project and when using constant test
    executions. Tests results are important early and often; they provide feedback on the
    current state of the system. Further, the faster the execution of the tests the more likely
    developers themselves will run the tests without waiting for the automated build tests
300                                                               Empir Software Eng (2008) 13:289–302


      results. Such constant execution of tests by developers may also result in faster unit
      tests additions and fixes.
–     Share unit tests. Developers’ sharing their unit tests, as an essential practice of TDD,
      helps identify integration issues early on.
–     Track the project using measurements. Count the number of test cases, code coverage,
      bugs found and fixed, source code count, test code count, and trend across time, to
      identify problems and to determine if TDD is working for you.
–     Check morale of the team at the beginning and end of the project. Conduct periodical
      and informal surveys to gauge developers’ opinions on the TDD process and on their
      willingness to apply it in the future.
